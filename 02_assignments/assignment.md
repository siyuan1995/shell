# Assignment: The Secret Password

You are stuck in a virtual room and can only leave if you figure out the password! Fortunately, somebody left behind 6 clues for you to find the secret password, but the messaging is not that clear. It is your job to discover what the secret password is!

1. The very odd and inedible ingredient in a cake recipe
2. The season number that contains only 18 episodes (Hint: How do you list them?)
3. Fifth word of Season 6, Episode 21 of Friends
4. Fifth word of the fifth fictional Space Wars series
5. Second word of this song that's exactly 4 minutes long in this "colour" album
6. The fourth word to the fourth Hunger Games movie

## Instructions
1. Fork this Shell learning module repository following these [instructions](https://github.com/UofT-DSI/onboarding/blob/main/onboarding_documents/submissions.md#setting-up)
2. Use your bash skills (such as `cd`, `cat`, etc.) to figure out what the secret password is! You will be exploring the `clues` directory in your bash terminal.
3. Write the secret password in your own version of this markdown file in your forked repo.

**What is the secret password?**
```
Your answer here...
1.So I am at assignment folder now
cd ..
"cd cluse"-> "ls" get recipe list
Then cat contents of the three txt, then find out "paper ring" is the odd one.

2.cd ../../ then cd shows ls
to find the count of item in each folder use this command: find . -mindepth 1 -maxdepth 1 -type d -exec sh -c 'printf "%s:\t" "$1"; ls -A "$1" | wc -l' _ {} \; | sort -k 2 -n
and you get this:
./season_10:          18
./season_1:           24
./season_2:           24
./season_4:           24
./season_5:           24
./season_7:           24
./season_8:           24
./season_9:           24
./season_3:           25
./season_6:           25

so the second answer is "10"

3.cd season_6 cat ep_21.txt. you get "The One Where Ross Meets Elizabeth's Dad" fifth word is "meets"

4.cd space_wars/fifth_movie.txt you get "Space Wars: Future Legends and Past Legacies" so the answer here is "Legacies"

5.find albums -type f -name "*.txt" -exec cat {} \;

Title: Red
Duration: 3:43
Title: Everything Has Changed
Duration: 4:05
Title: I Knew You Were Trouble
Duration: 3:39
Title: The Lucky One
Duration: 4:00
Title: Holy Ground
Duration: 3:22

This prints all the content of text file under album folder. so the answer for this one is "Lucky".

6.cd ../../ cd movies/hanger_games cat movie4.txt
the answer for this one is "stars"

In conclusion, based on the 6 clues, the secure key is "Paper ring 10 meets Legacies Lucky stars"
